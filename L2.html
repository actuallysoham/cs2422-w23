            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p> "Bug" is probably a bad term. ("A bug has crept in", as if on its own)
            <p> "Defect" and "Fault" are often used for hardware (or low level system) error
            <p> "Flaw", "Error", "Issue", "Failure", "Smell",...
            <p> Some people use the word infection (I don't like it.)
            <p> We'll just generically refer to bugs...

            <i>"In the meantime, I had another linguistic shock: I became a member of the ACM, shortly before its
                Communications started to appear. Prior to that I had hardly had any exposure to the foreign literature.
                What I then read was written in a way so totally different from what I, in relative isolation, had
                acquired as my own habit, that I was absolutely flabbergasted. The heavily anthropomorphic terminology
                was totally new for me, and hardly compatible with my cultural roots; so was the animism betrayed by the
                term "bug": we had never called a bug a bug, we had always called it an error."</i>

            <i>"We could, for instance, begin with cleaning up our language by no longer calling a bug a bug but by
                calling it an error. It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs, viz.
                with the programmer who made the error. The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in
                while the programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the
                programmer's own creation. The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a
                profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be "almost correct", afterwards a
                program with an error is just "wrong" (because in error)."</i><br/>

            <p> Maintain courtesy and trust

            <p> Developer should always thank the person who found the bug
